Hi guys. 
This is done using steps from the nodeJS start guide, it includes both frontend and backend.

We do not have to care anything about frontend since it will be done in the our frontend repo.

routes/insert.js and routes/select.js contains examples of SQL queries I think thats the main part.

Do look at the last section of the nodeJS start-up guide to store your database login details. 

Remember to set-up postgres on localhose before attempting anything.
